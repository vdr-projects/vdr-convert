This tool can be used to:
a) Generate a VDR 1.x index file
b) Generate subtitles in EN 300 743 compliant format as part of a 
   conversion to VDR2.x file (along with vdr-convert script)
c) Split VDR1.x files at a specified point. Note max total input size is
   now increased to 16Gb from the original 2Gb. vdr-convert needs 1 file

Useful if you lost the orginal index file or if you want to create an index
file for some other video stuff.

The tool is suitable for MPEG2 video (e.g. VDR1.x recordings) and MPEG1 video
(e.g. ripped VCD files).

If the tool is called without any commandline options, it searchs for VDR video
files (001.vdr, 002.vdr ...) in the current directory.
The generated index file will be named "index.vdr" or "index.vdr.generated" if
there is already an "index.vdr".

There are some commandline options to influence the behaviour of the tool:

  -q
  --quiet		no output to the console, except errors.

  -r
  --rewrite		enables rewrite mode, i.e. genindex reads all data
                        contained in the input file(s), filters out any crap
                        and/or data not usefull for VDR and writes the remaining
                        data to new file(s).
                        The output file(s) will be named 001.vdr, 002.vdr ...
                        and will not exceed the 2GB limit.
                        In no case any existing file will be overwritten, so you
                        cannot rewrite files from the current directory to the
                        current directory (use either -i or -d option).
                        Only data which is actually used by VDR is written to
                        output file(s), i.e. PES packets of type 0xE0-0xEF,
                        0xC0-0xCF, 0xBD and 0xBE.

  -d DIR
  --dest=DIR		Writes output files to directory DIR.

  -i FILE
  --input=FILE		Rather than scanning for input files, use FILE as single
                        input file.

  -s SIZE
  --split=SIZE		Split output files at a size of SIZE megabytes. Allowed
			input range is 1-2000.

  --skip=STR		In addition to the normal stream filtering, skip PES
			packets of type STR too. The value has to be given in
                        hexdecimal. You can give multiple --skip options, if you
                        want to skip more than one stream.

  -b                    Build EN 300 743 compliant subs instead of VDR1.x (implies -r)

  -n                    No progress indicator (like ffmpeg) 

The rewrite mode is especially useful if you want to prepare a single, huge
file for replay with VDR e.g. a DVD rip.
Assuming you have ripped the DVD to the file /tmp/rip.vob, you can prepare it
with (creating VDR video files in current directoy):

  genindex -r -i /tmp/rip.vob

If you additionaly want to skip any DolbyDigital audio stream:

  genindex -r -i /tmp/rip.vob --skip=0xBD

Or limit output files to 1GB:

  genindex -r -i /tmp/rip.vob -s 1000

This work was inspired by and is based on the work from Werner Fink and Sascha
Volkenandt (although virtualy no code pieces from their work made it into this
work).

HISTORY:

01.09.2016 - Version 0.2.0 rf
- Modified principally to process subtitles for vdr-convert script
  in EN 300 743 format, and remove initial short subs segments to help 
  ffmpeg successfully probe the streams
- added -b and -n flags

05.06.2006 - Version 0.1.3
- Added mode to rewrite video files (including file splitting and removing of
  PES streams).
- Allow a single input file >2GB in rewrite mode.

17.10.2003 - Version 0.1.2
- Don't choke on files >2GB but give the user a hint about the limitation.

27.07.2003 - Version 0.1.1
- Fixed index creation behond the first video file.
- Fixed index creation for broken video files (e.g. with skipped bytes).

26.07.2003 - Version 0.1.0
- Initial release.
